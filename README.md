The goal of this project is predicting regional food shortages by analyzing historical grain feed data to understand its impact on chicken production and subsequent import dynamics. By examining the relationship between grain feed and residual use data and chicken production, it aims to forecast potential shortages in the food pantry of chicken source regions. Through comprehensive data analysis, including trends in grain availability and consumption patterns, the research seeks to identify potential vulnerabilities in chicken-dependent food systems. Insights from this project can inform proactive measures to mitigate food shortages and enhance food security in regions reliant on imported chicken products.
