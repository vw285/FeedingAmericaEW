Utilizing techniques from COSC 6520(Data Analytics): The goal of this project is predicting monthly food shortages by county by analyzing historical grain feed data to understand its impact on chicken production and subsequent import dynamics. By examining the relationship between grain feed and residual use data and chicken production, it aims to forecast potential shortages in the food pantry of chicken source regions. Through comprehensive data analysis, including trends in grain availability and consumption patterns, the research seeks to identify potential vulnerabilities in chicken-dependent food systems. Insights from this project can inform proactive measures to mitigate food shortages and enhance food security in regions reliant on imported chicken products.

Utilizing R Shiny techniques from COSC 5500(Visual Analytics): Gaining insights into milk shortages and distribution patterns in Wisconsin counties is essential for improving food bank operations. Milk Buddy leverages data analytics to provide strategic insights and enhance food distribution networks for FAEW by using distribution data, receipt data, historical milk data, and monthly temperature data. We calculated the total monthly distribution weight of milk for each county in Wisconsin and the total recommended milk intake per county by month by using amount of people who are food insecure in every county in Wisconsin and their recommended daily dairy intake. By comparing the total amount of monthly milk distribution per county with the amount of monthly milk needed per county, Milk Buddy allows Feeding American Eastern Wisconsin (FAEW) operations team to gain strategic insights for decision making and reallocate milk resource to enhance milk distribution networks.
